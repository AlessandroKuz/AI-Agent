# AI-Agent

A simple project to build an AI-Agent using Gemini free API.

## Important Note

THIS IS A LEARNING ONLY PROJECT, THERE ARE KNOWN inherent security risks here.

The only limitations are the following:

- The LLM is able to run code only in a specific directory (the working_directory).
- A 30-second timeout is applied to prevent the code execution from running indefinitely.

But aside from that, the LLM can run arbitrary code that you (or it) places in the working directory... so be
careful.

Do not give this program to others for them to use! It does not have all the security and safety features that a
production AI agent would have. It is for learning purposes only.
